# Bookify

**Bookify** is a feature-rich booking and scheduling system built on the robust **MERN stack**. It provides a seamless user experience through **Context API** for global state management, **JWT authentication** for secure login/signup, **custom React hooks** for reusable logic, and a **dynamic calendar component** for intuitive date and reservation management.

This project is designed to make reservation handling smooth, secure, and efficient, whether for personal projects, small businesses, or enterprise use cases.
